ABSTRACT

Diabetes is a disease whereby blood sugar (glucose) is not metabolized in the body. In this
work different methods of machine learning techniques are used to predict diabetes using
dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. This
dataset has eight parameters. Standard Machine learning procedures are used, the data is
collected, visualized and prepared by cleaning. Two methods are used for cleaning,

Method 1- Column deletion and
Method 2- Replacing by mean.

Following algorithms are applied to both methods

1) k-nearest neighbor algorithm, 
2) decision tree, 
3) logistic regression, 
4) support-vector machine, 
5) na√Øve bayes and 
6) artificial neural network.
Confusion matrix for each algorithm is displayed and accuracy is calculated. By the
observation made, all the algorithms resulted in more than 73% of accuracy
